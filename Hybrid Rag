# HybridRAG

HybridRAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module designed to enhance document retrieval using a combination of dense and sparse search techniques. It utilizes FAISS for fast approximate nearest neighbor search, Annoy for efficient indexing, and TF-IDF for sparse vectorization to optimize query accuracy and speed.

## Features

- **Dense Vector Search**: Uses FAISS for high-dimensional vector search.
- **Efficient Indexing**: Employs Annoy for scalable nearest neighbor indexing.
- **Sparse Vectorization**: Utilizes TF-IDF for document representation.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines dense and sparse search results for improved accuracy.
- **Re-ranking**: Enhances search results by re-ranking based on similarity.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, use the following pip commands:

```bash
pip install faiss-cpu annoy numpy scikit-learn scipy
